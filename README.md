# AdventOfCode2017

- The first commit of each day is the immediate commit without changes after finishing part two of that day. I usually clean up and prettify my code shortly after, but i like having a documentation of where i came from. 

- I am doing the exercises twice (first in java, then in python) to improve my python.
